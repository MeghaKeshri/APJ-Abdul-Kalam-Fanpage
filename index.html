          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam ( 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian
          aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born
          and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
          He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at
          the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
          Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
          and military missile development efforts.
         <p class="para"> He thus came to be known as the 'Missile Man of India' for his work on the
          development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal
          organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
          the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>

          <p class="para"> Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the
          ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress.
          Widely referred to as the "People's President",he returned to his civilian life of education,
          writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious
          awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</p>

          <p class="para">While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
          Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands
          , including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown
          of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.</p>

    recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society
    "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project" <br>

 a certificate and ₹500,000 (US$6,600). The award will be awarded annually on Independence Day,
